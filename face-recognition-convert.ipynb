    "\n",
    "The original pre-trained weights for the **nn4.small2.v1** model are provided in CSV format by the Keras-OpenFace project.\n",
    "However, Keras models require weights to be loaded in a binary format for efficient usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, before using the model, these CSV weight files must be converted into a compatible binary format that can be directly loaded with Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "This conversion step:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reads the weight values from multiple CSV files\n",
    "* Reconstructs the full neural network weight matrices\n",
    "* Saves them into a single binary weight file\n",
    "* Enables fast and seamless loading using `model.load_weights()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once converted, the binary weights can be reused without repeating this process, making model initialization much faster and more convenient.\n"
